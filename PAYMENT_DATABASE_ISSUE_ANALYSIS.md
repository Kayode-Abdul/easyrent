# Payment Database Issue Analysis

## Problem
Payments are not being saved to the database after successful payment processing, even though the payment appears to be successful.

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Database Connection Issues
- Database connection might be failing during callback
- Transaction rollback due to errors
- Database permissions issues

### 2. Foreign Key Constraint Violations
- `tenant_id` might not exist in `users` table
- `landlord_id` might not exist in `users` table  
- `apartment_id` might not exist in `apartments` table

### 3. Data Type Mismatches
- `user_id` fields might be string vs integer mismatch
- `apartment_id` might be string vs integer mismatch

### 4. Callback Not Being Reached
- Paystack callback URL might be incorrect
- Callback might be failing before reaching payment creation code
- Network/firewall issues blocking callbacks

### 5. Validation Failures
- Required fields might be missing or invalid
- Enum constraints (status field only allows certain values)
- Field length constraints

### 6. Exception Handling
- Exceptions might be caught and logged but not visible
- Database transaction rollback hiding the real error

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Check Laravel Logs**: Look for any errors during payment processing
2. **Test Database Connectivity**: Ensure database is accessible during callback
3. **Validate Foreign Keys**: Ensure all referenced IDs exist
4. **Test Payment Creation Manually**: Create payment record directly to test constraints
5. **Add Comprehensive Logging**: Track every step of the payment process
6. **Check Paystack Webhook Logs**: Verify callbacks are being sent and received

## Debug Tools Created

- `debug_payment_callback.php`: Comprehensive callback testing
- `test_payment_creation.php`: Manual payment creation testing
- Enhanced logging in PaymentController
- Debug routes for testing callbacks
