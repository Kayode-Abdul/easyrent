# Route Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: "Route [dashboard] not defined" when accessing `/dashboard/billing`

## Root Cause
The codebase had references to `route('dashboard')` in:
- `resources/views/errors/403.blade.php` 
- `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php`

But the dashboard route was not named in the routes file.

## Solution Applied
Updated `routes/web.php`:

```php
// Before:
Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index'])->middleware('auth');
Route::get('/dashboard/billing', [BillingController::class, 'index'])->middleware(['auth', 'super.admin']);

// After:
Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index'])->middleware('auth')->name('dashboard');
Route::get('/dashboard/billing', [BillingController::class, 'index'])->middleware(['auth', 'super.admin'])->name('billing.index');
```

## Routes Now Working
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Main dashboard (named: `dashboard`)
- ✅ `/dashboard/billing` - Super admin billing page (named: `billing.index`)
- ✅ All route references now resolve correctly

## Security Features Confirmed
1. **Super Admin Middleware**: Only users with `admin = 1` can access billing
2. **Property View Security**: Clear separation between owner and admin actions
3. **Visual Security Indicators**: Security notices for non-owners viewing properties
4. **Company Revenue Tracking**: Enhanced admin dashboard showing EasyRent commission revenue

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test billing access with different user roles
2. Verify property view security notices appear for non-owners
3. Confirm admin dashboard shows company commission revenue
4. Test all route references work without errors
