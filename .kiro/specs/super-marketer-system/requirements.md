# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Super Marketer System introduces a 3-tier hierarchical commission structure that enables top-tier marketers to refer other marketers, creating a scalable referral network. This system includes regional commission management capabilities, allowing administrators to customize commission rates based on geographic locations and market conditions.
