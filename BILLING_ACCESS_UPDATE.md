# Billing Access Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Super Admin Restrictions
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/BillingController.php`
- **Before**: Only super admins (`admin = 1`) could access billing
- **After**: All authenticated users can access billing
- **Change**: Removed the admin check and replaced with a comment

### 2. Updated Route Middleware
**File**: `routes/web.php`
- **Before**: `->middleware(['auth', 'super.admin'])`
- **After**: `->middleware('auth')`
- **Change**: Removed the `super.admin` middleware, keeping only basic authentication

### 3. Updated Admin Dashboard Description
**File**: `resources/views/admin-dashboard.blade.php`
- **Before**: "Payment management" (implied admin-only)
- **After**: "View payments & bills" (general access)
- **Change**: Updated button description to reflect general access

## Current Access Level
âœ… **Billing page is now accessible to ALL authenticated users**

## Route Details
- **URL**: `/dashboard/billing`
- **Route Name**: `billing.index`
- **Middleware**: `auth` (authentication required only)
- **Controller**: `BillingController@index`

## What Users Will See
- **Authenticated Users**: Full access to billing page showing their payments and pending bills
- **Unauthenticated Users**: Redirected to login page
- **No Permission Errors**: The "You do not have permission to access this resource" message will no longer appear

## Security Note
The billing page now shows user-specific data only:
- Users see only their own payments (`tenant_id` matches their `user_id`)
- Users see only their own pending bookings (`user_id` matches their `user_id`)
- No sensitive admin data is exposed to regular users
